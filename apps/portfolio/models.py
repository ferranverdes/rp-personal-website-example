# CharField is used for short strings and specifies a maximum length.
# TextField is similar to CharField but can be used for longer form text as it
# doesnâ€™t have a maximum length limit.
# FilePathField also holds a string but must point to a file path name.
# URLField is a CharField for an URL, validated by URLValidator.

# __str__ function returns the representation, as string, for every Project instance.
