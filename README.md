# rp-personal-website-example
Beginner friendly Django project useful to learn the Django basics developing code at the same time. It provides a few branches in which each of them accomplishes different types of features, developed step by step to achieve its goals.

**Personal website example (project)** includes:
- **A portfolio (app)**: a simple gallery page containing all your web development projects that you have built, including their own clickable link to a project description page which provides more information. (based on [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/)).
- **A tech blog (app)**: a simple blog to show your development skills through some posts, which you are able to create, update or delete using Django Admin interface. Visitors are also able to leave comments using Django Forms (based on [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/)).
- **An API REST (app)**: application programming interface that uses Token Authentication and includes some tests in order to check the functionality of its viewâ€™s methods developed. These has been written using ModelViewSet, ViewSet and APIView classes to work with different possibilities.
- **OAuth 2 (app)**: authentication process using third-party services, in this case Google Cloud Platform.

It also includes:
- **Travis CI** configuration.
- **Dockers** configuration (coming soon).
- **Heroku** deployment (coming soon).
